			<td align="center">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was the first movie to me released in the Harry Potter franchise. It follows an 11 years old boy who learns that he is actually a wizard. He learns that his parents are dead and he was the only survivor because he was able to suvive the killing curse (something no one has ever done) and banish Voldemort even as just a baby. He enrolls in a wizarding school called Hogwarts where he learns about spells and magics and makes friends (mainly Ronald Weasely and Hermione Granger). Throughout the movie weird things keep happening aroun them. One night the three of them go on an adventure and found a threeheaded dog who is guarding something. They later learn that he is guarding the Sorcerer's Stone and someone is trying to steal it. After the teacher not believing them, they had to take things in their own hands. They went down and battled whatever was down there. This was also Harry and Voldemorts first meeting. The movie ended with Harry recovering and going home. </td>

			<td align="center">Harry is back now 12 years old. He gets locked in his room by the muggles. This was caused by a house elf who doesn't want Harry to got to Hogwarts because he claims it is dangerous. Some of the Weasley brother break him out and takes him to "the Burrow". Skip to when he is at hogwarts, strange things start to happen and he hears voices in the walls. Throughout the year many students were being paralized by an unkown reason. They learn about the chamber of secrets that only the heir of Salazar Slytherin can open. He learns that he is a parselmouth, which is a very unusal skill and is asscociated to evil which led people to think he did it. He meets a man named Tom Riddle. At the end harry was able to go down to the chamber, fight the culprit (a basilisk), and its master. They then managed to escape and reunite with the others. </td>
			<td align="center">Harry is now 13. He accidentally "blew up" his Aunt Marge and ecapes. Luckly he was not expelled from Hogwarts because there is a fugative after him, Sirius Black, who escaped from Azkaban. The school is now being guarded by Dementors. The problem is that the Dementors and very drawn to him so he has to defend himself. In comes professor Lupin, the new dada teacher who helps him there. Harry learns that Sirius Balck is is God fatehr and he was imrpisoned for betraying the Potters. Fast forward, Sirus Black is infront of him and many things (truths) were revealed that night. But when everything was going well and they are leaving prof. Lupin turns into a werewolf and things turn crazy. It leads to them nearly getting killed, Sirus getting captured once again and will be killed. But apparently, Hermione has a time turner and with the permission of Prof. Dumbledore they went back in time and changed Sirus fate and he escapes.</td>
			<td align="center">The fourth movie is where things get darker. Harry goes to the Quidditch World Cup and deatheaters (Voldemorts subjects) attacks it. Harry goes to Hogwarts and learns that there is the Triwizard Tornament where only 18 and up can join. He tells himself he will stay out of trouble, but that didn't go according to plan because he was chosen by the cup to join. There are 3 schools joining, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang and Hogwarts. Harry was forced to join and does 3 dangerous tasks. In the 3rd task, it turns to be a set up by Voldemorts subjects. This leads to voldemort gets reincarnated and another player dies.</td>
			<td align="center">There is now a secret organization reformed called the Order of The Phoenix who fights againts Voldemort or atleast Voldemorts subjects. A lot of people doesn't belive Harry. Harry gets sent to Hogwarts where he also makes his own oragization because their dada class is now completely useless and they need to learn how to protect theirselves. Harry then dreams of Mr. Wealsey dying and he was right, so Mr. Weasley is now safe. Voldemort keeps getting to his mind and that turns to be somethng very danegrous because he shows Harry a vision of Sirius getting killed. Harry and his members then goes to the location and sees that it is not true. They get ambused by death eaters and a battle happens. Its end by Sirius actually dying and Voldemort and Dumbledor battling and Voldemort getting seen by the minister and in turn proof that he is alive.</td>
